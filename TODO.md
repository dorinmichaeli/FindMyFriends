# TODO

- Find out how to change the app's name and icon in the apps view in the device.
- Find out if we really need both COARSE_LOCATION and FINE_LOCATION permissions in the manifest
  file. Android Studio says we need both, currently we're using only FINE_LOCATION and it seems to
  work.

## Current

- (DONE) Add error handling to the app.
- (PARTIALLY DONE) Organize the code in the app.
- Add a loader to the app.
